                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">One of the first things I recommend doing when starting out learning
                    web development is to decide upon a clear end goal,
                    and keep it in mind.

                    Maybe you want to make a career change. Maybe you have a wicked idea for an app. Or maybe you just
                    want to learn for
                    fun.

                    Whatever your goal, it’s important to understand why you are doing this. This understanding will
                    help you be more
                    productive with your learning time. It will also help encourage you through those times when you
                    feel like giving up.</p>

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">Web Development is an art of creating and transforming thoughts into
                    reality. It is a fast-pacing industry and is not
                    going to dwindle so soon. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the employment of Web
                    Developers is projected to
                    grow 13 percent by 2028, much faster than the average for all occupations. Web Developers involved
                    in Web Development
                    possess a combination of graphic design skills and computer knowledge. Though this set of skills
                    varies from
                    organization to organization, the overall responsibilities and Web Developer skills remain the same.

                <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">The speed of innovation in the web development space is accelerating
                    every year. Five or ten years ago it seemed
                    impossible that we’d be able to build such powerful and performant applications in the browser as we
                    are able to in 2021
                    — like Netflix, Facebook, Spotify or AirBnB. As the demands from browser apps continue to become
                    more
                    complicated, web developers increasingly need better and more
                    versatile tools to keep up with rising expectations. Thankfully, we’ve never been more spoilt for
                    choice, with both
                    established companies and community members racing to build better libraries, frameworks and apps to
                    make life easier
                    for developers. </p>
